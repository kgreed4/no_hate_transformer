## Introduction

The rise of hate speech and offensive content on social media platforms has become a significant concern. This project aims to address this issue by providing a deep learning solution to automatically classify tweets into two categories: hate/offensive speech or non-hate/non-offensive speech.

The provided Transformer model offers a robust and efficient way to process and classify tweets, leveraging the power of self-attention mechanisms.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the Transformer model for hate speech detection, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/hate-speech-transformer.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd hate-speech-transformer
    ```

3. **Train the Model:**
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```

4. **Evaluate the Model:**
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py
    ```

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation contains labeled tweets, where each tweet is annotated as either hate/offensive speech or non-hate/non-offensive speech. You can find more details about the dataset in the `data/` directory.

## Model Architecture

The Transformer model used in this project is based on the encoder-only variant. It consists of multiple stacked encoder layers, each containing self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward neural networks. The model effectively captures contextual information from the input tweets, enabling accurate classification.

## Training

The training process involves optimizing the model parameters using a labeled dataset. During training, the model learns to classify tweets into hate/offensive speech or non-hate/non-offensive speech categories by minimizing a predefined loss function. You can customize the training process by adjusting hyperparameters in the `model.py` script.

## Evaluation

After training, the model's performance is evaluated on a separate test set to assess its accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics. The evaluation script provides insights into the model's effectiveness in hate speech detection.
